  {{#if userInfo.email}} It looks like your public email address is {{userInfo.email}}.
  {{else}} It looks like you don't have a public email. That's cool.
  {{/if}}

  {{#if userInfo.private_emails}}
  With your permission, we were also able to dig up your private email addresses:
  {{#each userInfo.private_emails}}
    {{email}}{{#unless @last}},{{/unless}}
  {{/each}}
  {{else}}

  {{/if}}
